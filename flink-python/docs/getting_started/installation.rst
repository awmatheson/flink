Installation
============

Environment Requirements
------------------------

.. note::
   Python version (3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12) is required for PyFlink. Please run the following command
       to make sure that it meets the requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python --version
   # the version printed here must be 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12

Environment Setup
-----------------

Your system may include multiple Python versions, and thus also include multiple Python binary executables.
    You can run the following
``ls`` command to find out what Python binary executables are available in your system:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls /usr/bin/python*

To satisfy the PyFlink requirement regarding the Python environment version, you can choose to soft link ``python`` to point to your ``python3`` interpreter:

.. code-block:: bash

   ln -s /usr/bin/python3 python

In addition to creating a soft link, you can also choose to create a Python virtual environment. You have several options:

**Option 1: Using uv (recommended)**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install uv if you haven't already
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # Create a new virtual environment
   uv venv # or uv venv --python 3.11
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

**Option 2: Using Python's built-in venv module**

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

You can refer to the :doc:`../deployment/prepare` documentation page for details on how to achieve that setup.

If you don't want to use a soft link to change the system's ``python`` interpreter point to, you can use the configuration way to specify the Python interpreter.
For specifying the Python interpreter used to compile the jobs, you can refer to the configuration :doc:`../user_guide/configuration`.
For specifying the Python interpreter used to execute the Python UDF, you can refer to the configuration :doc:`../user_guide/configuration`.

Installation of PyFlink
-----------------------

PyFlink is available in `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/apache-flink/>`_ and can be installed as follows:

**Option 1: Using uv (recommended)**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Add PyFlink to your project dependencies
   uv add apache-flink
   
   # Or install directly without adding to pyproject.toml
   uv pip install apache-flink

**Option 2: Using pip**

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python -m pip install apache-flink

You can also build PyFlink from source by following the `development guide <https://flink.apache.org/docs/latest/flinkdev/building/#build-pyflink>`_.

.. note::
   Starting from Flink 1.11, it's also supported to run
   PyFlink jobs locally on Windows and so you could develop and debug PyFlink jobs on Windows.
