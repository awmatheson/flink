Performance Tuning
==================

This section covers performance optimization techniques for PyFlink applications.

-----------------------

Several factors affect PyFlink application performance:

* **Parallelism**: Number of parallel instances for operators
* **Memory Configuration**: Heap and off-heap memory settings
* **State Backend**: Choice of state storage backend
* **Network Buffers**: Network buffer configuration
* **Checkpointing**: Checkpoint interval and timeout settings

-------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pyflink.datastream import StreamExecutionEnvironment
   from pyflink.table import StreamTableEnvironment, EnvironmentSettings

   # Create execution environment
   env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()

   # Set global parallelism
   env.set_parallelism(4)

   # Set parallelism for specific operators
   ds = env.from_collection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   ds = ds.map(lambda x: x * 2).set_parallelism(2)
   ds = ds.filter(lambda x: x > 5).set_parallelism(1)
