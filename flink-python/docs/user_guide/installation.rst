Installation
============

Environment Requirements
------------------------

.. note::

   Python version (3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11) is required
   for PyFlink. Please run the following command to make sure that it meets
   the requirements:


.. code:: bash

   $ python --version
   # the version printed here must be 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11

Environment Setup
-----------------

Your system may include multiple Python versions, and thus also include
multiple Python binary executables. You can run the following ``ls``
command to find out what Python binary executables are available in your
system:

.. code:: bash

   $ ls /usr/bin/python*

To satisfy the PyFlink requirement regarding the Python environment
version, you can choose to soft link ``python`` to point to your
``python3`` interpreter:

.. code:: bash

   ln -s /usr/bin/python3 python

In addition to creating a soft link, you can also choose to create a
Python virtual environment (``venv``). You can refer to the :doc:`Preparing
Python Virtual Environment <faq#preparing-python-virtual-environment>` documentation page for details
on how to achieve that setup.

If you don't want to use a soft link to change the system's ``python``
interpreter point to, you can use the configuration way to specify the
Python interpreter. For specifying the Python interpreter used to
compile the jobs, you can refer to the configuration
:doc:`python.client.executable <python_config#python-client-executable>`. For specifying the Python interpreter
used to execute the Python UDF, you can refer to the configuration
:doc:`python.executable <python_config#python-executable>`.

Installation of PyFlink
-----------------------

PyFlink is available in
`PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/apache-flink/>`__ and can be installed
as follows:



.. code:: bash

   $ python -m pip install apache-flink=={{ version }}

 

.. code:: bash

   $ python -m pip install apache-flink



You can also build PyFlink from source by following the :doc:`development
guide <../flinkDev/building#build-pyflink>`.

Note Starting from Flink 1.11, itâ€™s also supported to run PyFlink jobs
locally on Windows and so you could develop and debug PyFlink jobs on
Windows.
